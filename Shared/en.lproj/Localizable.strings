When I was 8 years old, I went to the Rudolstadt Festival for the first time (at that time it was the \"TFF Rudolstadt\"). Since then, I have been going to the festival again and again and I still find great joy in it. By now, I'm 27 years old, writing my master thesis in computer science, and have been working as a professional software developer for several years now next to my studies. As I have been unhappy for quite some time about certain things in the official app being a bit impractical, I got the idea that I could write an app for the festival myself in my spare time. No sooner said than done! Originally I just wanted to use the app myself, but because I'm very happy with the result now, I decided to publish it. Have fun with it!";
